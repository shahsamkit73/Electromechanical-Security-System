# Electromechanical-Security-System

With the latest technological advancements in the 21st Century, human beings are more concerned with security, convenience and comfort. As technology rapidly changes, so has crime. Hence, better and cheap innovations need to be developed to counter the new crime tactics. Also, with people leading a busy lifestyle, there is a necessity of protection of your home security against theft. The goal of the project is to design and implement a smart home system for defence system by using an application of electromechanical structure of mechanical parts which detect the intrusion and indicate with ringing alarm. In addition to make a more secure system, wireless communication will be used through zigbee device which will perform autolock task. This is with the aim of improving safety and security and providing more efficient utilization of technology.
